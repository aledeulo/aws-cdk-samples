Synthesizing stacks:
The cdk synth command synthesizes a stack defined in your application into an AWS CloudFormation template. 

cdk synth                 # if app contains only one stack
cdk synth stack1          # Synthesizes only selected stack
cdk synth stack1 stack2   # Synthesizes multiple selected stacks
cdk synth *               # all stacks in app


Deploying stacks:
The cdk deploy command provisions your stacks into your AWS account after successful synthetization of your application into a template. This process includes the creation of cloud resources, security groups, and IAM changes necessary to administer your deployment. 

cdk deploy                   #deploys stack
cdk deploy stack1            #deploys single stack
cdk deploy stack1 stack2     #deploys both stack1 and stack2
cdl deploy *                 #deploys all stacks in the project folder.


Removing stacks:
If you no longer have a use for a deployed stack, use the cdk destroy command to remove all resources in the stack from your AWS account.

cdk destroy                   # destroys stack(s) associated with project
cdk destroy stack stack2      # destroys stack1 and stack2
cdk destroy stack*            # destroys all stacks in the project folder.  
# Note ‘/’ can also be used in place of ‘*’
